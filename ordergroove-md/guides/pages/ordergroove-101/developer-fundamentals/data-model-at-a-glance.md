Overview

[](#overview)

Ordergroove’s data model is designed to provide flexibility to end users with a structure that allows for full automation or client-specific processes via rest APIs. All data is stored in a Relational Database, with both one-to-one and one-to-many relationships depending on how you look at the data.

There are four main data objects:

1.  [Customer](#customer)
2.  [Subscription](#subscription)
3.  [Items](#items)
4.  [Order](#order)

# 

Merchant

[](#merchant)

Every Ordergroove client and unique integration has a merchant record in Ordergroove. Some clients may have multiple sites (separate brands, locales, etc); these are usually separate Merchants in Ordergroove. A merchant is usually represented by a _Merchant Public ID_ when interacting with Ordergroove API endpoints.

* * *

# 

Customer

[](#customer)

Customers are created in Ordergroove via purchase post, or via customer migrations from other platforms. Customers have Subscriptions, which are tied to active customer Address and Payment information.

# 

Subscription

[](#subscription)

Customers have subscriptions. Each product a customer is subscribed to is its own subscription, and is referenceable via a subscription public ID. A subscription creates a recurring order based on the subscription’s frequency, and the discounts applied to the item or order subtotal are determined by the Offer ID associated with the subscription.

## 

Important Subscription Data

[](#important-subscription-data)

*   id (Ordergroove subscription ID)
*   public\_id (public Subscription ID)
*   customer\_id (Ordergroove customer ID of customer associated with this subscription)

*   quantity (quantity of product subscribed to)
*   payment\_id (Ordergroove payment ID, the payment object associated with this subscription)
*   shipping \_address\_id (Ordergroove payment ID, the shipping address object associated with this subscription)
*   frequency\_days (number of days between each subscription order’s place date)
*   offer\_id (the Ordergroove offer ID tied to the subscription, this links incentive logic for recurring orders to the subscription)
*   merchant\_order\_id (the ecommerce order number that created the subscription)
*   live (Boolean value, live=0 customer has no active subscriptions, live=1 customer has at least one active subscription)
*   every (numeric value of frequency)
*   Every\_period (numeric value of the frequency period, 1=days, 2=weeks, 3=months, 4=years)

## 

Key Relationships

*   Subscription > Item
*   Subscription > Offer (incentive)

* * *

# 

Order

[](#order)

Orders are created by subscriptions, and contain items and all relevant information used to place orders to your eCommerce platform. Orders contain one or more items, and their place date is determined by previous order date + subscription frequency. Subscriptions only have one upcoming order, a subsequent order will be created when the current order is placed.

##

*   public\_id (public order ID)

    *   1 - unsent
    *   3 - rejected
    *   5 - success
    *   6 - send now
    *   11 - pending placement
    *   15 - generic error
    *   18 - credit card retry
*   sub\_total (order subtotal after subscription discounts)

# 

Items

[](#items)

Items are the individual products within an order. They may be associated with a subscription, or can be a one-time product that was added to a single order.

*   Public\_id (public item ID)
*   Order\_id (Ordergroove order ID associated with the item)

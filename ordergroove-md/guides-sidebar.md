# Developer Fundamentals

[Suggest Edits](/edit/developer-fundamentals)

It can take some time and patience to learn the ins and outs of a new platform. Developing on Ordergroove's platform doesn't need to be costly or time-intensive though, with just a little background information you can keep ramp-up time to a minimum.

This article will link you out to crucial information you'll need to know, and is good to know, to get you up and running as quickly as possible. We're here to support you through each step of your journey, if you have any questions, please reach out.

## 

Data Model

[](#data-model)

Ordergroove’s data model is designed to provide flexibility to end users with a structure that allows for full automation or client-specific processes via rest APIs. Ordergroove’s data is stored in a Relational Database, with both one-to-one and one-to-many relationships depending on how you look at the data.

Ordergroove has four main data objects:

*   Customer
*   Subscription
*   Items
*   Order

For more information and a relational flowchart, take a look at [Data Model at a glance](/docs/data-model-at-a-glance).

* * *

## 

Systems Landscape Map

[](#systems-landscape-map)

Ordergroove’s platform has six major integration components that power your relationship commerce experience. We have applications and cartridges for various eCommerce platforms that will automatically handle many of these components.

Even though the application automates some components, we still believe it is helpful to introduce those major components to help provide you with a full understanding of the integration.

Take a look at Ordergroove [Systems Landscape Map](/docs/landscape-map) for information on all six components and a relational chart.

* * *

## 

API Authentication

[](#api-authentication)

You can authenticate requests using either API key or an HMAC, depending on personal preference. API keys can be viewed and managed in the [Ordergroove Dashboard](https://ordergroove.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/10601238595987); for more information take a look at [Authentication](/reference/authentication).

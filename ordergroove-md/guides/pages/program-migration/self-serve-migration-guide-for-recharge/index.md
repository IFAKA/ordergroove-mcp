# Self-serve migration guide for Recharge

[Suggest Edits](/edit/self-serve-migration-guide-for-recharge)

Migrating from Recharge with a Stripe integration over to Ordergroove can be done using Ordergroove‚Äôs migration tool. There are many benefits of migrating over to Ordergroove so we are excited to have you onboard. We‚Äôll walk you through how to migrate over from Recharge.

> ## üëç
> 
> Timeframes
> 
> The timeframes provided are a general estimate, and should not be taken at face value. There are a number of factors that could affect your program launch such as project resources, custom add-ons, and the scope of the project.

This guide is meant to help you get through migration in the ‚Äúhappy path scenario‚Äù where everything is working as it should. When things are configured correctly, the process can take a few hours with more than 70% of your data importing successfully. In the event you experience errors or some data not successfully migrating, don‚Äôt worry, we are here to help. For any questions regarding errors, data issues, or anything else, [open a ticket](https://help.ordergroove.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and someone from the Ordergroove migrations team will help you.

## 

Migration Overview

[](#migration-overview)

The migration process is broken up into three high-level steps:

1.  Preparation - you‚Äôll be getting your migration ready. This typically takes less than an hour
2.  Test migration - you‚Äôll be doing a test migration to ensure your preparations were set up correctly. The time it takes depends on how much data you have
3.  Final migration - you‚Äôll be officially moving over all of your Recharge active subscriber data over. The time it takes depends on how much data you are migrating

This guide is meant to help you get through migration in the ‚Äúhappy path scenario‚Äù where everything is working as it should. When things are configured correctly, the process can take a few hours with more than 70% of your data importing successfully. In the event you experience errors or some data not successfully migrating, don‚Äôt worry, we are here to help. For any questions regarding errors, data issues, or anything else, [open a ticket](https://help.ordergroove.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and someone from the Ordergroove migrations team will help you.

> **Do NOT uninstall Recharge** from your Shopify store until the migration is successful and it is working as you would like.

## 

Preparations

[](#preparations)

To get your migration started, you‚Äôll need to complete a few steps to prepare for it. You‚Äôll need to:

1.  Create a Recharge API token
2.  Create a test customer/subscription to migrate
3.  Confirm your Shopify Checkout requirements

### 

1\. Create a Recharge API token

[](#1-create-a-recharge-api-token)

_Takes about 5 minutes to complete_

A Recharge API token is what allows Ordergroove to extract data from Recharge. To create one, follow the following steps:

1.  Open the Recharge app inside Shopify
2.  On the left side nav bar, click **Apps** and then click **API Tokens**
3.  Click **Create an API token button** on the top right
4.  Fill out the form
    1.  Token nickname will be your name
    2.  Contact email will be your email address
    3.  API Client Secret will be left blank
5.  Change the _Scope settings_ to **Read access** for each permission. This allows Ordergroove to read the data to be migrated
    1.  You can leave _Custom Notifications_ permission as **No access**
6.  Check the Terms of Service consent
7.  Click **Save**

![](https://files.readme.io/2cb7b61-blobid0.png)

8.  Your Recharge API key is created and you‚Äôre all set.

### 

2\. Create a test customer/subscription

[](#2-create-a-test-customersubscription)

_Takes about 5 to 10 minutes to complete_

A test customer/subscription is a subscription in your subscription program associated with you or one of your employees. **Create a customer in Recharge using your (or another employee‚Äôs) information.**

This creates a litmus test of the migration from beginning to end:

1.  Extract data from Recharge
2.  Import the test customer/subscription into Ordergroove
3.  Place an order through Ordergroove into your Ecomm system
4.  Confirm payment processed correctly

If you‚Äôd like to create more than one to test, feel free to do so. Make sure to keep the email address for each handy as you will need to reference them later.

### 

3\. Confirm your Shopify checkout configurations

[](#3-confirm-your-shopify-checkout-configurations)

_Takes about 5 minutes to complete_

The last step is to ensure the Shopify checkout settings are configured correctly.

**Ensure your [subscription field requirements](https://rc3.ordergroove.com/settings/subscription_validation) are set in Ordergroove to match the data you're importing**.

1.  Navigate to your Shopify store and click on **Settings** located on the bottom left of the navigation
2.  Click **Checkout** on the left navigation
3.  Under the **Customer information** section
    1.  If **Shipping address phone number, Address line 2,** or **Company** **name** field are set as **Required**, [open a ticket](https://help.ordergroove.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) requesting Ordergroove to enable the specific fields in Ordergroove.
    2.  **If Shipping address phone number**, **Address line 2**, or **Company name** field are set as **Don‚Äôt include** or **Optional**, you‚Äôre all set.

* * *

## 

Test Migration

[](#test-migration)

Now that the preparations are complete, you will want to do a test run of the migration. The time this takes depends on the size of data you are migrating over. A more established subscription program means more data therefore means longer migration times. This can range from a few minutes to several hours. But, keep in mind, this is a one time thing you will have to do.

A test migration requires the following:

1.  Downloading the migration tool
2.  Transforming the Recharge data for use in Ordergroove
3.  Testing the data integrity
4.  Resolve errors

By doing a test migration, you will also get familiar with the migration tool and how it works so when the time comes for the final migration, you will fly through it.

### 

1\. Downloading the migration tool

[](#1-downloading-the-migration-tool)

_Takes about 3-5 minutes to complete_

The migration tool will allow Ordergroove to download from Recharge and transform it so I can be used within Ordergroove.

Here‚Äôs how to download the migration tool:

1.  Log into [Ordergroove](https://rc3.ordergroove.com/tools/program_migrations/?rechargeTransformV2)
2.  Click the **Profile button** in the navigation
3.  Click **Developers**
4.  Click **Migrations** or go directly to the Migrations page [here](https://rc3.ordergroove.com/tools/program_migrations/?rechargeTransformV2)

![](https://files.readme.io/cb13da7-blobid0_1.png)

5.  On the Migrations page, click **RECHARGE EXPORT**
6.  In the Download Export Tool section, select **Windows** or **Mac**
7.  Keep the migrations page open while the tool downloads as you will need the Merchant ID and Offer ID to configure the migration tool

![](https://files.readme.io/cc3a6e5-blobid2.png)

### 

2\. Transforming the Recharge data for use in Ordergroove

[](#2-transforming-the-recharge-data-for-use-in-ordergroove)

_Takes 10 minutes to an 1 hour to complete, depending on data size_

It‚Äôs time to download the data from Recharge and transform it for use in Ordergroove.

**Note**: For this step, you will need the Recharge API key you created during preparation.

Open the tool you just downloaded, and go through the following steps:

1.  Read through the EULA
2.  Choose a directory to download the data and Click **Next**
3.  Paste the Merchant ID from the Migrations page [here](https://rc3.ordergroove.com/tools/program_migrations/?rechargeTransformV2)
4.  Paste the Offer ID from the Migrations page [here](https://rc3.ordergroove.com/tools/program_migrations/?rechargeTransformV2)
5.  Paste the Recharge API token
6.  You can skip the ‚ÄúBraintree credentials‚Äù view

That‚Äôs it. The data will start downloading from Recharge and we‚Äôll transform into a format our system can understand. Upon completion, in the download directory, you‚Äôll have six (6) files available to you.

*   Four (4) files containing the raw customer, address, subscription, and payment data extracted from Recharge. Their filename formats are as follows:
    *   rc-\-customers
    *   rc-\-addresses
    *   rc-\-subscriptions
*   One summary file containing a count of payment processors:
    *   _rc-\-transformed-data-for-migration-to-ordergroove.json.summary_
    *   **Note**: If you see any payment processor BESIDES ‚Äústripe‚Äù - please stop and [open a ticket](https://help.ordergroove.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) with us immediately.
*   One file containing the transformed data:
    *   _rc-\-transformed-data-for-migration-to-ordergroove.json_
    *   **This is the file we'll be using for the next step.**

If there are any errors, you‚Äôll want to **start from scratch**. If you run into any issues here do not hesitate to [reach out](https://help.ordergroove.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to us.

### 

3\. Testing the data integrity

[](#3-testing-the-data-integrity)

_Takes 10 minutes to an 1 hour to complete, depending on data size_

Now that we've downloaded and transformed the data, it's time to test the data integrity.

1.  Go back to the [Migrations](https://rc3.ordergroove.com/tools/program_migrations/) page in Ordergroove.
2.  Make sure you‚Äôre on the ‚ÄúTest Run‚Äù tab

![](https://files.readme.io/b7761d1-mceclip3.png)

> ## üöß
> 
> Note
> 
> If you do not see the Shopify logo and the message ‚ÄúThis migration will include Shopify contracts‚Äù the payment processing test will fail later. Please [open a ticket](https://help.ordergroove.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) with us before moving forward.

3.  Click on the Upload button and select the ‚Äútransform‚Äù file from the previous step.

A new row will appear in the table below indicating that the Test Run process has begun

![](https://files.readme.io/761e5a8-mceclip4.png)

Periodically check back on this page. We‚Äôre waiting for the Processing Status column to move from ‚ÄúIn Progress‚Ä¶‚Äù to ‚ÄúCompleted‚Äù at which point you can download Unprocessed, Errors, and Successful files.

If you run into any issues here, please [open a ticket](https://help.ordergroove.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) with us.

### 

4\. Resolve Errors

[](#4-resolve-errors)

_Takes 10 minutes to more than 1 hour to complete, depending on data size_

You‚Äôll know the data integrity checks have completed when the row containing "Processing Status" column shows **Completed** for the file you uploaded

![](https://files.readme.io/d04a270-blobid3.png)

If instead you see the status as **Cancelled**, you'll want to retry uploading and testing your file.

![](https://files.readme.io/f1da3c9-blobid4.png)

You‚Äôll notice that we have three columns:

*   **Successful** - a file consisting of all the customers and their respective subscription information that passed initial validations. This file would represent something you could attempt to import in the ‚ÄúMigration‚Äù tab - but we‚Äôre not ready for that yet
*   **Errors** - this file is similar in structure to the ‚ÄúSuccessful‚Äù file except we found some data integrity issues that you‚Äôll need to resolve.
*   **Unprocessed** - this file is more for debugging purposes. This represents data that we simply could not put together or understand. Some examples: there are subscriptions referencing a customer that does not exist in the migration file, invalid JSON, etc.

Error remediation can be by and large the most time consuming (and frustrating) part of a migration process. This is why we‚Äôre in a preparatory phase - if you get ahead of it now, you won‚Äôt feel bad taking a break and coming back to it later.

Here are some resources that we think should be helpful to get you going

*   You can get a better understanding of the types of errors you might encounter in the error file in the Errors section in the [Knowledge Center](https://help.ordergroove.com/hc/en-us/articles/6351678016403).
*   If you‚Äôre feeling more adventurous, we have a script/utility you can use to parse the error file and provide more of a summarized view of the file. It takes the file and focuses on the errors, showing the errors that manifested for each specific customer.

At the end of the day, you‚Äôll have to look in that file to determine which customers are having which problem.

Because we're still in the preparation stages, you‚Äôll want to make any data modifications in Recharge. After you‚Äôve done so, feel free to go back to step 2 and repeat the subsequent steps until you feel comfortable with the data extraction, transformation, and validation.

* * *

## 

Migration Day

[](#migration-day)

At this point, you should already have your program with Ordergroove live.

Now that we've done some practice runs, we should be ready for the real migration. This requires the following:

1.  Configuring Stripe in Shopify
2.  Downloading and validating the data
3.  Setting up the test customer file
4.  Importing the test customer/subscription
5.  Placing a test order
6.  Validating payment processing
7.  Importing the full data set
8.  Resolving any errors

### 

1\. Configuring Stripe in Shopify

[](#1-configuring-stripe-in-shopify)

_Takes about 5 minutes to complete_

Please refer to our [Knowledge Center article](https://help.ordergroove.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407418681363) on how to connect your Stripe account from Recharge to your Shopify store.

### 

2\. Downloading and validating the data

[](#2-downloading-and-validating-the-data)

_Takes 5 minutes to 1 hour to complete depending on data size_

Please refer to step 2, Transforming the Recharge data for use in Ordergroove in the Test Migration section above for details about how to download and validate your Recharge data using our tools.

### 

3\. Setting up the test customer file

[](#3-setting-up-the-test-customer-file)

_Takes about 10 minutes_

In the ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù file, you‚Äôll need to locate the test customer

1.  Open the success file
2.  Do a search for the email address of the test customer
3.  Cut the entire contents of the row corresponding to the test customer
4.  Open a new file
5.  Paste the data of the test customer into a new file
6.  Make sure you don‚Äôt leave a blank line in the success file

You‚Äôll want to give the file containing the test customer a representative name, for example: _test\_customer\_for\_og\_migration.json_

If the test customer is in the error file, you can extract it just the same as above, but because there were errors, you‚Äôll need to make some modifications to the data.

### 

4\. Importing the test customer/subscription

[](#4-importing-the-test-customersubscription)

_Takes about 10 minutes to complete_

1.  Click on the **Migration** tab on the [Migrations](https://rc3.ordergroove.com/tools/program_migrations/) page in Ordergroove. If you do not see the Shopify logo and the message "**This migration will include Shopify contracts**‚Äù the payment processing test will fail later. Please [open a ticket](https://help.ordergroove.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) with us before moving forward.

![](https://files.readme.io/2e2f8a6-mceclip1.png)

2.  Use the ‚ÄúUpload‚Äù button to select the test customer file we created in the previous step.

> ## ‚ùóÔ∏è
> 
> Warning
> 
> **Be extra careful and make sure you pick the correct file.** If you feel you accidentally uploaded the wrong file (aka - the full data set), please reach out to us immediately so we can get in front of halting the process sooner rather than later. There is currently no way for you to stop this process once it begins.

3.  A new row will be added to the table and you‚Äôll see that the file you provided will be listed as ‚ÄúIn Progress‚Ä¶‚Äù

![](https://files.readme.io/4632952-mceclip4.png)

When the process is over, download all three file types. If everything worked correctly, both the ‚ÄúErrors‚Äù and ‚ÄúUnprocessed‚Äù files should be empty and the ‚ÄúSuccessful‚Äù file should contain your test customer. If that‚Äôs the case please move on to the _Placing a test order_ section below. Otherwise, please keep reading.

#### 

TEST CUSTOMER IMPORT ERROR

[](#test-customer-import-error)

Sometimes, even after all the preparation, the test customer can still result in an error. While we do our best to give you detailed errors so you can feel confident in the changes you need to make for a successful import, some errors require a little bit more explanation.

*   "**Shopify store is not configured with a payment gateway that allows customers to purchase subscriptions**."  
    If you see this error it means that your store has not met Shopify‚Äôs ‚Äú[subscription eligibility requirements](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/products/subscriptions/setup?shpxid=9ab54aec-CF7E-4D98-0117-9B5C17F4A64B#eligibility-requirements).‚Äù Feel free to reach out to us and we‚Äôll do our best to assist you any way we can. You can then repeat importing the test customer once you feel this has been resolved.
*   "**Shopify store has not connected Stripe as a secondary payment gateway**."  
    If you see this error, it means there‚Äôs no Stripe account connected to your Shopify store. You‚Äôll need to follow thek steps [Shopify recommends](https://shopify.dev/apps/subscriptions/migrate/contracts#step-1-configure-your-payment-gateway-to-work-with-subscriptions) in order to connect your Stripe account. We also recommend checking out our Knowledge Center article on [troubleshooting connecting Stripe to Shopify](https://help.ordergroove.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407418681363-Shopify-and-Stripe-Error-Troubleshooting). You can then repeat importing the test customer once you feel this has been resolved.

For any other errors, please feel free to remediate as you see fit and retry importing the test customer

1.  Modify the error file
2.  Save your modifications
3.  Go back to the start of step 4, Importing the test customer/subscription
4.  Be very careful to make sure you pick the correct file.

### 

5\. Placing a test order

[](#5-placing-a-test-order)

_Takes about 15 to 20 minutes to complete_

Now that the test customer has been successfully imported, the most import question can be answered: _Can a customer be charged when an order is placed?_

To test this, you'll use some of Ordergroove's tools to facilitate and verify this.

1.  Navigate to the customer search screen by selecting the ‚ÄúCustomers‚Äù link under the ‚ÄúData‚Äù section of the navbar

2.  Search for the test customer's email address
3.  Click on the customer row to be brought to a more detailed view. You should take a moment to verify that all the test customer information is as you expected
4.  Click ‚ÄúView All‚Äù on the left side of the **Orders** section in this view

![](https://files.readme.io/a924974-mceclip3.png)

5.  Click on the upcoming order of the test customer so it expands
6.  Click the ‚ÄúSend Now‚Äù button on the top left
7.  Click ‚ÄúSave‚Äù

![](https://files.readme.io/538432c-mceclip4.png)

At this point, we‚Äôll want to wait for the Order Placement system to run. It will fetch the order and attempt to push it into your Ecomm system. Feel free to occasionally reload the page.  
After a little bit, you should see the order update. If you see it was in a ‚ÄúSuccess‚Äù state, move on to the next step, Validating payment processing. Otherwise, here are some notes to consider with respect to failed order placement.

#### 

If you see a Placement Failure

[](#if-you-see-a-placement-failure)

1.  To find out why an order was not successfully placed, checkout our order placement section under the Data section of the navbar

![](https://files.readme.io/3bdcfbb-mceclip5.png)

2.  In the "Filter" section, set the search filter to ‚ÄúEmail‚Äù
3.  In the ‚ÄúValue‚Äù section, provide the test customer email address.

You should see two rows, click on the ‚ÄúResponse‚Äù button to gain insight as to why the order was rejected.

If the system had a timeout communicating with your Ecomm system, that‚Äôs OK. We‚Äôll retry that again.

If it‚Äôs payment related, you should look for the test customer in your Shopify store. In Shopify's customer view, if their payment was successfully migrated, the customer information will typically display information with respect to name on card, last 4 digits, etc. You should see something like the following on the right hand side of the customer view.

If not, there‚Äôs a good chance something might be wrong with how Stripe is configured with the Shopify store. If this is the case, please check out our article on [troubleshooting connecting Stripe to Shopify](https://help.ordergroove.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407418681363-Shopify-and-Stripe-Error-Troubleshooting).

This however requires some help from us. We‚Äôll need to move the test customer ‚Äúout of the way‚Äù so to speak. The main reason: if you have a payment issue in Shopify, but the data got into Ordergroove, you‚Äôll need to start the import process from the beginning. However, all the data already exists and we have many checks that ensure we don‚Äôt double import any data. We can help make it so that you can re-import the test customer.

It‚Äôs worth nothing, this situation is exactly why the test customer is so valuable: it‚Äôs much easier to resolve one single customer than an entire program.

Worst case scenario, don't hesitate to [open a ticket](https://help.ordergroove.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) with us.

### 

6\. Validating payment processing

[](#6-validating-payment-processing)

_Takes about 5 to 10 minutes to complete_

With Shopify reporting the order as being successful and that being reflected in Ordergroove, we can now verify that the card was indeed charged successfully. Please refer to Shopify‚Äôs guide on [how orders are processed](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/orders/understanding).

1.  Search for the test customer's email in Shopify admin‚Äôs customer section:  
    _https://{{YOUR-SHOP-DOMAIN}}.myshopify.com/admin/customers_
2.  Confirm that Shopify was able to capture payment.
    *   It should be enough if Shopify reflects this, but it may also be worth it to wait for the charge to appear on the test customer‚Äôs credit card.
    *   If you don‚Äôt see the payment captured for that order within a reasonable amount of time, you may need to review your [Stripe integration](https://help.ordergroove.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407418681363-Shopify-and-Stripe-Error-Troubleshooting). We also recommended that you [open a ticket](https://help.ordergroove.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) with us at this point.

### 

7\. Importing the full data set

[](#7-importing-the-full-data-set)

_Takes 10 minutes to more than 1 hour to complete, depending on data size_

1.  Click on the **Migration** tab on the [Migrations](https://rc3.ordergroove.com/tools/program_migrations/) page in Ordergroove. If you do not see the Shopify logo and the message "**This migration will include Shopify contracts**‚Äù the payment processing test will fail later. Please [open a ticket](https://help.ordergroove.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) with us before moving forward.

![](https://files.readme.io/2e2f8a6-mceclip1.png)

2.  Once again, click on the Upload button and select the Successful file downloaded from the step 2, Downloading and validating the data
3.  A new row will appear in the table below indicating that the import process has begun.
4.  Periodically check back on this page. We‚Äôre waiting for the Processing Status column to move from ‚ÄúIn Progress‚Ä¶‚Äù to ‚ÄúCompleted‚Äù at which point you can download Unprocessed, Errors, and Successful files.

If you‚Äôve followed all of our steps, you should have been able to successfully import a good amount if not all of your data into the Ordergroove platform.

### 

8\. Resolving any errors

[](#8-resolving-any-errors)

_Takes 10 minutes to more than 1 hour to complete, depending on data size_

Now comes the trickiest part of the migration process: error remediation. Because it‚Äôs migration day, any changes you make to remediate errors will have to be done **directly in the Errors file**.

> ## üöß
> 
> Note
> 
> You should always re-run the previous run's error file.

*   Each row represents all the data of a customer
*   If **ANY** data for the customer has an error, they will appear in this file

Let‚Äôs give extra attention to the last bullet: if a customer has multiple subscriptions and only one has an error, all of the good data will be imported. The error file includes all of this data as well as the error data. Take great care when modifying these files.

1.  **Errors in Test Run tab  
    **If you have an Errors file in the ‚ÄúTest Run‚Äù tab, it is recommended to make updates to that file and then execute the ‚ÄúTest Run‚Äù tab again. This may produce another Errors file, but any data in the Successful file should be good to go in the ‚ÄúMigration‚Äù tab.
2.  **Errors in the Migration tab**  
    If you have an Errors file from the ‚ÄúMigration‚Äù tab, you'll need to modify this file and retry importing it.

Here are some resources that we think should be helpful to get you going:

*   Check out [this article](https://help.ordergroove.com/hc/en-us/articles/6351678016403) to familiarize yourself with how the data and errors in these files are structured.
*   Check out [this article](https://help.ordergroove.com/hc/en-us/articles/360062704833-Dry-Run-Error-Messages) to better understand the types of errors you might encounter in the error file.

If you‚Äôre feeling more adventurous, we have a [script/utility](https://github.com/ordergroove/migration-utilities/tree/main/errors_summary) you can use to parse the error file and provide more of a summarized view of the file. It takes the file and focuses on the errors, showing the errors that manifested for each specific customer.

It‚Äôs up to you which one you prefer to tackle first and how much time you want to dedicate.

For your own peace of mind, we take many precautions to ensure the migration is an idempotent process, but you can help! Think of re-running errors like a relay race: the previous error file passes the baton to the next runner and so on and so forth until there are hopefully no errors left.

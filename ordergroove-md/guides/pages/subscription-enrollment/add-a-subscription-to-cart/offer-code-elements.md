# og-next-upcoming-order

This element displays the placement date of one's next upcoming order.

# og-offer

This element displays a complete offer, allowing one to opt in, opt out, and change the frequency of an optin. The product attribute is required except in the case that either preview-standard-offer or preview-upsell-offer are true. If the product is upsell-eligible, the element will display an upsell offer. If the product is not upsell-eligible but is subscription-eligible, the element will display an offer for the specified type, or an offer of radio type if type is not specified. Upsell eligibility and subscription eligibility are determined at runtime based on response data from a request made for the specified product. If a product is neither upsell-eligible nor subscription-eligible, nothing is displayed.

This element contains two slots. The iu-template slot is displayed when the product is upsell-eligible. The standard-template slot is displayed when the product is not upsell-eligible but is subscription-eligible.

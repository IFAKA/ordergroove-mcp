# Instant Upsell Overview

[Suggest Edits](/edit/getting-started-2)

Instant Upsell (IU) is a feature that allows existing subscribers to add items to their upcoming subscription orders as either a one-time delivery or as a new subscription. If an item is eligible for subscription, the subscriber can add it via Instant Upsell, either as a one-time delivery or a subscription.

If an item is not eligible for subscription, it can still be added via the IU feature, but the subscriber will be restricted to adding it as a one-time delivery.

## 

Compatibility

[](#compatibility)

*   Instant Upsell only applies to stores that use Ordergroove-hosted offers.
*   The recurring discount you set for your program is applied to all Instant Upsell products, regardless if the customer chooses a one-time or subscription purchase.

* * *

## 

Overall Experience

[](#overall-experience)

When a customer is logged in and has an upcoming order, Ordergrove can serve an Instant Upsell offer in place of your standard opt-in on your Product Details Page or Quick View modal. On the Subscription Manager, the customer will see an Instant Upsell banner, which you can configure to redirect customers to an area of your site with Instant Upsell eligible products.

## 

Customer Opt-in Experience

[](#customer-opt-in-experience)

*   The customer will see the Instant Upsell button upon page load, instead of the offer, if they match the above criteria, displayed as an **Add this to my order** button.

*   Upon clicking the **Add this to my order** button, the customer will be presented with a modal to add the item as a one-time purchase or to subscribe for recurring orders.

![](https://files.readme.io/a26abe3-IU2.jpg)

*   After clicking the **Add to Order** button, the customer will see a success confirmation message in the place where they previously saw the **Add this to my order button** and will be given the option to view their upcoming order, which will lead the customer to their Subscription Manager page, via the **View Upcoming Order** button.

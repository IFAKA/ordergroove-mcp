# Bundle Subscriptions

[Suggest Edits](/edit/bundle-subscriptions)

Our new bundle suite provides an innovative approach to subscription management, allowing users to oversee a single subscription with multiple items. Customers can customize their bundle by selecting which items they want, offering flexibility and a streamlined order management process.

## 

New Bundles Capabilities

[](#new-bundles-capabilities)

Ordergroove's legacy bundles are represented by a **single line item** for the entire bundle, whereas the new bundles model allows for **multiple line items** to be linked to the same subscription.

Here’s how orders are represented in the legacy bundles vs the new bundles:

![](https://files.readme.io/0ee703b-image2.png)

Legacy bundles have item components in their single item while new bundles have multiple items linked to the subscription component. Both use subscription components.

## 

New Bundles Model

[](#new-bundles-model)

Each subscription includes linked subscription components that dictate the creation of bundle items. These bundle items are standard SKU products delivered to customers, while the subscription itself is governed by a "bundle parent product" that defines the bundle's behavior.

![](https://files.readme.io/f4c3c6b-Understanding_Bundles.jpg)

## 

New Bundles Benefits

[](#new-bundles-benefits)

*   Inventory management is more precise, as each item's specific SKU and quantity are accurately deducted from the stock
*   Flex incentives can apply to each item
*   Orders are more straightforward to manage as items will be changed and not components. This gives the ability to change the item only for the current order
*   Customers can edit their orders more intuitively
*   APIs have direct control over components
*   The initial checkout order is the same as any regular checkout order facilitating fulfillment
*   Offers two different types of pricing models (dynamic and static)

## 

Dynamic vs Static Price Bundle

[](#dynamic-vs-static-price-bundle)

Ordergroove offers two types of bundle pricing to accommodate a variety of use cases:

### 

Dynamic price bundle:

[](#dynamic-price-bundle)

In dynamic bundles, each item retains its standard price. If a customer swaps an item for another of a different value or adjusts quantities, the bundle's total price changes accordingly, summing up the individual prices of all items.

![](https://files.readme.io/a4e87fa-Screenshot_2024-05-21_at_13.55.39.png)

*   Dynamic bundle pricing is similar to having multiple subscriptions being shipped together
*   The price of the product set in the item will always be followed, even when an item is SKU swapped.
*   **The parent product price must be set to $0 in dynamic bundles.**

### 

Static price bundle

[](#static-price-bundle)

For static bundles, the total bundle price is determined by the parent product's price. Individual item prices within the bundle are adjusted in a weighted manner so that the sum equals the parent product's price, ensuring the bundle's total price consistently reflects the parent product's price plus any incentives. **The parent product price must be set to a positive value in static bundles.**

![](https://files.readme.io/ac00532-Screenshot_2024-05-21_at_13.55.48.png)

The **$20** price of the bundle parent product will be distributed between all items in a weighted manner. Each item adjusted price is calculated by:

![](https://files.readme.io/66a2629-Screenshot_2024-05-21_at_16.22.15.png)

Here is a price breakdown of each item price calculation.

*   Order total before adjustments: $15 + $20 + $5 = **$40**
*   Item 1 original total price: $15. Adjusted Item Price = ($15/$40) \* $20 = **$7.5**
*   Item 2 original total price: $20. Adjusted Item Price = ($20/$40) \* $20 = **$10**
*   Item 2 original total price: $5. Adjusted Item Price = ($5/$40) \* $20 = **$2.5**

* * *

## 

Important Considerations For Static Bundles

[](#important-considerations-for-static-bundles)

*   Occasionally, in static bundles with incentives, **the total may be slightly off by one or two cents**. This discrepancy is due to how incentives are applied individually to each item, rather than to the entire bundle order. For example in one bundle order costing $10 with 20% off we expect the total to be $8. As the bundle divides the 20% discount for all items, some of them might lose a few cents due to the weighted price of static bundles. In this case, the total discounted bundle price could be $7.99 instead of $8.
*   If the sum of item prices within the bundle is less than the parent product's price, **the pricing will default to dynamic**, based on the normal prices of the products rather than the parent product's price. For example, if the parent product is priced at **$60**, and the items are priced at $15, $20, and $5, totaling **$40**, the order will be calculated at **$40** ignoring the parent product price. The sum of item prices must exceed the parent product price to qualify for static bundle pricing. This ensures customers are not overcharged.

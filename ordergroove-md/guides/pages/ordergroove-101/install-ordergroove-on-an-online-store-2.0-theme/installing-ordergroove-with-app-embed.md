# Installing Ordergroove with App Embed

[Suggest Edits](/edit/installing-ordergroove-with-app-embed)

Ordergroove’s new _App Embed_ allows you to set up Ordergroove on your theme without any injection into your theme’s code. The app embed is a streamlined instance of the ordergroove\_static\_asset.liquid file that is already on any theme with Ordergroove installed and injected. We'll discuss how it affects themes, why the change was made, and how you can set it up.

## 

How does this affect my current theme?

[](#how-does-this-affect-my-current-theme)

It doesn’t! **If you already have Ordergroove installed on your theme, do not enable the app embed.**

Enabling the app embed yourself on a theme that already has Ordergroove snippets on it could cause serious bugs if you have an older Ordergroove integration. Contact our [support team](https://help.ordergroove.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) for more information.

How do I set it up?

[](#how-do-i-set-it-up)

A streamlined onboarding flow with the new App Embed is coming, but in the meantime you can install it yourself on a fresh Online Store 2.0 theme with the following steps. Note that at this time, you don’t need to take any action; these steps are only if you want to get set up on a new theme that does not have Ordergroove injected directly into the code.

### 

Step 1: Access Theme Files

[](#step-1-access-theme-files)

1.  **Log in** to your [Shopify admin panel](https://admin.shopify.com/).
2.  Go to **Online Store** and select **Themes**.
3.  Locate and **choose the theme** you want to customize.
4.  Click on the **Actions** dropdown and select **Customize**.

### 

Step 2: Turn on App Embed

[](#step-2-turn-on-app-embed)

1.  On the left side of your screen, click the icon for **App Embeds**.
2.  Enable **Ordergroove Offers Embed**.

### 

Step 3: Add Blocks

[](#step-3-add-blocks)

1.  Navigate to a product page in the customizer.
2.  Below the _Product Information_ menu, click **Add block**.
3.  In the _App Blocks_ section, select **Ordergroove Offer**.
4.  The Ordergroove offer block will be added; you can rearrange it on the page.
5.  **Navigate** to the customer account page (log in as a customer.)
6.  If your customer account page has a space for blocks where you want to add the block, follow the above steps but instead add block _Ordergroove SMI_. Contact our [support team](https://help.ordergroove.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) if you don’t see a place for blocks.
7.  Below the customer-account menu, click **Add block**.
8.  Under _App Blocks_, select **Ordergroove SMI**.

# Migrate my data to Ordergroove

[Suggest Edits](/edit/program-migration)

Ordergroove uses newline delimited JSON file where each customer's data is its own JSON object on its own line. Use one line per customer. Addresses and payments and subscriptions are connected using their IDs in the origin object.

* * *

## 

Example: Single Customer JSON Object

[](#example-single-customer-json-object)

You need to create the below object for each customer and put each object on a new line in a file:

JSON

`{     "customer": {         "merchant" : "n83hg5fm7d82345f727dk203",         "merchant_user_id": "2398573030",         "first_name": "Sam",         "last_name": "Smith",         "email": "[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)",         "live": true,         "phone_number": null,         "extra_data": null,         "price_code": null,         "created": "2021-02-26 18:15:07",         "origin": {             "id": "3452345784"         }     },     "addresses": [         {             "customer": "2398573030",             "address_type": "billing_address",             "first_name": "Sam",             "last_name": "Smith",             "address": "1 Fifth Ave",             "city": "New York",             "state_province_code": "NY",             "zip_postal_code": "10003",             "country_code": "US",             "live": true,             "phone": "555-123-4567",             "origin": {                 "id": "3452277044"             }         },         {             "customer": "2398573030",             "address_type": "shipping_address",             "first_name": "Sam",             "last_name": "Smith",             "address": "1 Fifth Ave",             "city": "New York",             "state_province_code": "NY",             "zip_postal_code": "10003",             "country_code": "US",             "live": true,             "phone": "555-123-4567",             "origin": {                 "id": "61377044"             }           }     ],     "payments": [         {             "customer": "2398573030",             "live": true,             "token_id": "274573947",             "cc_holder": "Sam Smith",             "cc_type": 2,             "cc_exp_date": "09/2022",             "created": "2021-02-26 18:15:07",             "origin": {                 "id": "567563456",                 "billing_address": "3452277044"                    }         }      ],     "subscriptions": [         {             "customer": "2398573030",             "product": "3g2375g385",             "offer": "b6b8cf7c52346234652342b6aba89ec1ea9",             "merchant_order_id": "18076256",             "live": true,             "every": 4,             "every_period": "week",             "quantity": 1,             "price": "18.99",             "start_date": "2020-07-21",             "cancelled": null,             "next_order_date": "2021-03-21",             "multi_item_bundle_components": [                 {                     "product": "44284019474619",                     "quantity": 2                 },                 {                     "product": "44284019343547",                     "quantity": 1                 }             ],             "currency_code": "USD",             "rotation_ordinal": 0,             "origin": {                 "id": "56723446",                 "payment": "567563456",                 "shipping_address": "61377044"             }         },         {             "customer": "2398573030",             "product": "09832ng9739",             "offer": "b6b8cf7c52346234652342b6aba89ec1ea9",             "merchant_order_id": "18076256",             "live": false,             "every": 3,             "every_period": "month",             "quantity": 1,             "price": "48.99",             "start_date": "2020-07-21",             "cancelled": "2020-09-21 10:21:56",             "next_order_date": null,             "currency_code": "USD",             "rotation_ordinal": 1,         "origin": {             "id": "2435764567",             "payment": "567563456",             "shipping_address": "61377044"             }         }     ] }`

Migrating to Shopify & Shopify Payments

[](#migrating-to-shopify--shopify-payments)

If needed, the Ordergroove migration system can import certain types of payment methods into Shopify Payments. Please reach out to Ordergroove for your specific payment migration needs. The following example is a record for migrating a Stripe payment to Shopify Payments when using the Stripe Legacy Gateway feature on Shopify:

`{   ...   "payments": [      {         "customer": "11112222334455",         "live": true,         "token_id": "cus_ABCDEFG1234567",         "billing_address": null,         "public_id": null,         "cc_number": "1111",         "label": null,         "cc_holder": null,         "cc_type": 2,         "cc_exp_date": "12/2030",         "payment_method": "credit card",         "created": null,         "last_updated": null,         "origin": {           "id": "payment-0",           "billing_address": "billing-0",           "payment_processor": {             "type": "stripe",             "data": {               "token": "cus_ABCDEFG1234567",              "stripe_payment_method_id": "..."             }           }         }      },      ...   ] }`

The origin object provides a “payment\_processor” field which is where you can populate the data necessary to migrate your customer’s payment Shopify Payments. Here are the different payment types supported and their accompanying field requirements:

### 

Stripe

[](#stripe)

`{   ...  "payment_processor": {     "type": "stripe",     "data": {         "token": "STRIPE_CUSTOMER_TOKEN",         "stripe_payment_method_id": "..."     }  } }`

### 

Paypal

[](#paypal)

`{   ...   "token_id": "PAYPAL_BILLING_AGREEMENT_ID",    "payment_method": "paypal",   ...   "origin": {     ...     "payment_processor": {       "type": "paypal",       "data": {         "token": "PAYPAL_BILLING_AGREEMENT_ID"       }     }   } }`

# Product Feed

[Suggest Edits](/edit/integrating-with-a-custom-platform)

The Product Feed is a file that is transmitted via SFTP to our platform on a recurring basis, to allow us to keep synchronized with your product information. This feed should contain all products, regardless of whether they are eligible for subscriptions or not. We check for the existence of these files every 30 minutes, so you can provide a new copy as often as once every 30 minutes.

If the product feed is not sent continuously throughout the day it is highly recommended that the product feed run prior to order placement run-time, in order to prevent any orders from being rejected for out of stock issues.

* * *

## 

Requirements

[](#requirements)

The product feed should be created with the following format:

Filename: <MERCHANT\_ID>.Products.xml  
Drop site location: <SFTP\_SITE>

> ## ðŸš§
> 
> Note
> 
> Any applicable field containing special characters (e.g. &, trademark symbols, accents, etc.) must be wrapped in CDATA. Best practice is to always wrap product names and category names in CDATA at a minimum.
> 
> Fields labeled "Optional" should be excluded from the file if they do not contain a specific value, as we will attempt to validate them if they are included. Example: if not setting an "in\_stock" boolean value, please remove <in\_stock></in\_stock> tagging entirely vs. adding empty tags or using self-closing XML tags eg <in\_stock/>.

* * *

## 

Example

[](#example)

XML

`<products> ... <product>   <name><![CDATA[Product XYZ]]></name>   <product_id>AB4483902</product_id>   <sku>45987234980</sku>   <groups> // These fields are optional     <group type="sku_swap"><![CDATA[Product Group A]]></group>     <group type="incentive"><![CDATA[Incentive Group A]]></group>   </groups>   <price>19.99</price>   <details_url>http://www.merchanturl.com/details/product.com</details_url>   <image_url>https://www.merchanturl.com/images/product.jpg</image_url>   <autoship_eligible>1</autoship_eligible> //Optional   <in_stock>1</in_stock>   <discontinued>0</discontinued> //Optional   <extra_data> //Optional     <field key="variant_name">Size X</field>   </extra_data>   <relationships> //These fields are optional     <relationship>       <name>discontinued_replacement</name>         <related>           <product_id>12</product_id>         </related>       </relationship>     </relationships>   <every>6</every> //Optional   <every_period>2</every_period> //Optional </product> ... </products>`
